Item Title: ZKTeco Biometric Attendance & SMS Notification System (Python)
________________________________________
Short Description:
A robust, production-ready Python system that connects to ZKTeco biometric devices, polls for attendance logs in real-time, and automatically sends SMS alerts to parents. A complete, business-in-a-box solution for schools, perfect for developers or IT integrators.
________________________________________
Full Description:
Tired of building attendance systems from scratch? This is a complete, professional-grade solution that bridges the gap between ZKTeco hardware and real-world school needs. We've spent hundreds of hours solving all the complex edge cases so you don't have to.
This system is not just a simple script; it's a fully automated, multi-process backend service designed for stability and reliability. It's currently deployed in a real-world boarding school environment, handling thousands of logs without issue.
Live Preview / Demo:
Since this is a backend service, a traditional live preview isn't feasible. Instead, we provide:
• Full, commented source code for you to review.
• Screenshots of the folder structure, log file output, generated Excel reports, and the central MySQL database.
• A comprehensive README.md file that guides you through every step of the installation and configuration.

Key Features:
• Direct Device Integration: Connects directly to ZKTeco devices using the pyzk library.
• Real-Time Polling: Runs as a persistent background service, checking for new attendance logs every few seconds.
• Accurate IN/OUT Logic: Intelligently interprets the device's punch code (0 for Check-In, 1 for Check-Out) to accurately determine the action. This is far more reliable than state-toggling logic.
• Multi-Device Architecture: The system is designed to run one isolated Python process per device, preventing a single failing device from crashing the entire system. Management scripts (start_all, stop_all) are included.
• Automatic SMS Notifications: Seamlessly integrates with the Sematime API to send instant, personalized SMS alerts to parents or guardians.
• Dual Data Logging:
1. Central MySQL Database: All records are stored in a structured SQL database for easy reporting and building a future web UI.
2. Local Excel Reports: Each device script automatically generates its own daily Excel log for simple, offline access.
• Robust Error Handling: The script is wrapped in extensive try...except...finally blocks. It will handle network timeouts and device freezes gracefully without crashing, logging the error and automatically retrying.
• Detailed Logging: Creates comprehensive, rotating log files for each device, making troubleshooting and monitoring a breeze.
• Easy Configuration: All key parameters (device IPs, database credentials, API keys) are located at the top of the script for easy setup.

How It Helps You:
For a School's IT Department:
• Deploy a Finished Product: Get a professional parent notification system running in hours, not months.
• Increase School Value: Provide a premium service (SMS alerts) that parents love and that enhances student safety and accountability.
• Automate Manual Work: Eliminate the need for staff to manually check logbooks and call parents.
For a Freelance Developer or Integrator:
• Business-in-a-Box: Rebrand this script and sell it to multiple schools as your own solution. The robust backend is already done.
• Perfect Foundation: Use this reliable data-collection engine as the backend for a more advanced school management system with a web dashboard (e.g., using Flask or Django).
• Save Hundreds of Hours: We have solved the tricky parts: concurrent database access, Access DB file handling, stateful logic issues, multi-threading vs. multi-processing architecture, and robust error handling.
